## TO DO:

1. Copy all images on Eight's profile page and edit html img links to private hosting (wordpress)
2. Copy all images from krovris.neocities.com to krovris.space
3. Redesign Eight's profile page / update to a more modern 'tesseract' profile
4. Redesign Morningstar's profile page
5. Design Kopek's profile
6. Design Calypso's profile

## Ideas:

?) rewrite the character template to make editing easier
?) share template on toyhouse
?) design a warning page for Toyhouse
?) find out how to make recordings of each page to put on portfolio site (krovris.space)

## Important!

Is there a way to share JUST THE CHARACTER PROFILE as an insert into a webpage? It would make sharing the design so much easier as it would also be animated but that would probably require javascript...
